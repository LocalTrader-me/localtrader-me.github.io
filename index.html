<p>What is a Local Trader?</p>
<p />
<p>"A local trader is a person who participates in financial markets with the goal of buying and selling securities on her own account, rather than acting as a representative for investors. A numbers of terms are used to refer to local traders including registered trader, competitive trader, and floor trader. These traders help to maintain liquidity in financial markets, although they contribute a relatively small percentage of overall trades, with the bulk of trades involving institutiomal investors working at very high volume."</p>
